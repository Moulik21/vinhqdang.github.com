This is my note for the course [When Market Fails](https://www.coursera.org/learn/microeconomics-part2) taught by [Rebecca Stein](https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/faculty/rebecca-stein) at [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/).

# Disclaimer

I am somewhat familiar with fundamental concepts of microeconomics and the power of free market. I am quite curious to learn about *dark side* of free market.

The notes is quite personal and maybe not follow exactly what has been taught, but also my personal adding views.

## Week 1

### Introduction

### Cost & Profits

#### Recall to some basic mathematics:

```
profit = revenue - cost
revenue = price * quantity
cost = fixed cost + variable cost
```

#### Marginal productivity

```
marginal_productivity = change_output/change_input
```

Usually looks like below. The marginal productivity goes down because of [the law of diminishing marginal productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_product).
