Deep learning is becoming more democracy. [mxnet](mxnet.io) is providing the R interface along with [other packages](https://www.is.uni-freiburg.de/resources/r-oeffentlicher-zugriff/deep-learning-in-r/deep-learning-in-r-en?set_language=en).

I would suggest mxnet because it is quite new and support different neural architerctures.

[Here](http://rpubs.com/vinhdq/mnist_dnn_mxnet) is a simple feed-forward neural networks implementation in R with mxnet for MNIST task.
