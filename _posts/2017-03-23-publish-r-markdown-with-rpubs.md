[Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/about/getting-started) is a very simple way to publish Rmarkdown document. Everything you need is [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and a free account at Rpubs.

[Here](http://rpubs.com/vinhdq/credit_card_fraud_detection) is my first Rpubs publication.
